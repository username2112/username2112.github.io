### About

I am a computer Science kid who's been in various development environments since 3rd grade. Computer game development and the broader field of computer science have been decade long interests of mine and I've made strides to reaching a mastery in the topics. I have developed proficientcy in C, C#, Robot C, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I've primarily worked in software for data entry and analysis with FRC Team 2412 and created a unity based mobile data entry program where students are able to interactively record information of robots competing in FRC competitions to help our team better plan a strategy. I also durring COVID tutored AP Computer Science as well as Python students who averaged a B grade in their classes by the end of the year.
